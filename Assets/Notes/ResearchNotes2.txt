<p class="note-text bold">PROJECT TWIN SPARK - TOP SECRET</p>

<p class="note-text italic">August 2024</p>
<p>Project Twin Spark, or the <label class="note-text bold">Teleswapper</label>, as I've begun to refer to it, is progressing nicely. The unique power supply is incredibly powerful! 
If I can learn to harness it on my other projects, it will enable my inventions to reach new heights! Though, I'm still a little miffed that I
dragged the entire enclosure home to work on it, when simply bringing the power supply with me and building a new enclosure around it on-site
would have sufficed. Oh well, live and learn. Now that I know <label class="note-text bold">the power supply is the only important bit</label>, that only strengthens my resolve to
put it to use on other projects.</p>

<p>My new assistant has been invaluable in testing the device lately. Leaving that Swap Anchor at his home has made it possible to use a 'Custom Setting' on the Teleswapper,
though it is somewhat disappointing that we can only swap to places we've visited before. Oh well. Progress continues steadily, though <label class="note-text bold">the device creates burn 
marks at the location of each target</label> upon swapping, and I am concerned my assistant is going to ask me to pay to repair his flooring. Need to invent burn-proof floor tile.</p>

<p>Note to self - <label class="note-text bold">don't leave the device unplugged.</label> Internal CMOS battery does not seem to play nice with the power supply, and requires constant power 
from the wall main to remain functional. Since the device is mainly powered by it's own custom power supply I was hoping to untether it completely, so this is an annoying setback. Need to find
an alternative.</p>
