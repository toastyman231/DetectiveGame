Det. Thorn:And here's our victim. Hm... I have no idea who this is.
Det. Thorn:Well, until the squad arrives to bring this stiff to the coroner, I suppose I'll have to make my own deductions.
Det. Thorn:Let's see... Adult male, doesn't seem to be carrying any personal possessions...
Det. Thorn:Cause of death... well I can't know for sure, but it sure seems like he was stabbed to death.
Det. Thorn:Unfortunately, I think that's all I can say for now.
