Det. Thorn:Seems to be some kind of machine? An invention presumably. What does it do?
Det. Thorn:There's two labels on the front - 'Custom Setting' and 'Nearest'. The dial is set to Nearest.
Det. Thorn:There's some scratches on the table under the machine, like it was dragged. 
Det. Thorn:The device is unplugged, and there seems to be a piece missing. I wonder if I might find it around here somewhere?
